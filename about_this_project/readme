if you are a university student and interesting about c/c++ programming in linux system, 
then you might feel interested in this project, please take a look;
(sadly, chinese only, i'm not so much good at english, translate all this takes a lot time, i cant finish that kind of job by my own)

thanks for all the people who helped me, supported me, care about me, thank you.

2024/03/14, celebrate today!! 
all the mission list for this project's beginning, today now is all finished(should be finished);
after today, fixed bug only, should be no big update,
but this is good enough for a university student to learn linux c++ programming, enjoy it;
i wish my grandma can see it, her boy finished the mission today, the mission start from 2015, today now is finished!!
anyway, it's a new start to the author today, and this project it's really [landmark-freeze] [landmark-freeze] [landmark-freeze]!!
what i can show, what i can tell, 
today this project should be enough to support a young university student to grow up, to be a good linux c++ programmer,
good luck, young person,
when i was a student, i wish my study life can somebody help me, but none,
then i start a long plan to learn everything by my own,
and i did it, finished it today;
i dont know what should i do, maybe i cant take the funny part from you guys(young prople),
maybe i should keep my mouth shut just like ...
but i wont, i wont do that,
for the best kind of wish, i hope you have some fun in this project, young person;

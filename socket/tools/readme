# socket tools:
# 	all this network tools only for programming debug, 
# 	actually there so many hacking tools like: nmap, hping, MSF framework, wget, ffmpeg ... 
# 	i think show up all the skill is not so good, 
# 	you dont need to learn this tools now, i mean when you are older enough, you will know how to use it,
# 	a words form a old man:
# 		when you are young, you should put more time to learn how to programming, 
# 		not just fooling around, playing ont thing like i am so big deal, actually i was a young kid too, focus guys;
# 		this is important
